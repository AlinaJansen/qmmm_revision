2024-02-01 11:03:03.115895 Rejected one optimization step due to energy increasing. Trying again, with smaller step.
2024-02-01 11:03:03.119194 Reduced stepsize = 2.4193770666157783e-07
2024-02-01 11:03:03.218387 Step became lower than 0.000001 a.u., optimization is considered done for now. This is the best we can do unless reaching unacceptable numerical noise levels.
2024-02-01 11:03:03.232780 Optimization finished due to step size.
