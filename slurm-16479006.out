NOTE 1 [file testopt.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.


NOTE 2 [file testopt.mdp]:
  Setting nstcalcenergy (100) equal to nstenergy (1)


NOTE 3 [file testopt.mdp]:
  You are using a cut-off for VdW interactions with NVE, for good energy
  conservation use vdwtype = Shift (possibly with DispCorr)


NOTE 4 [file testopt.mdp]:
  You are using a cut-off for electrostatics with NVE, for good energy
  conservation use coulombtype = PME-Switch or Reaction-Field-zero

Setting the LD random seed to 431991228
Generated 2145 of the 2145 non-bonded parameter combinations
Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Generated 2145 of the 2145 1-4 parameter combinations
Excluding 3 bonded neighbours molecule type 'QMMM_model'

NOTE 5 [file testopt.qmmm.top, line 219]:
  System has non-zero total charge: -0.955900
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.
  



NOTE 6 [file testopt.qmmm.top, line 219]:
  The bond in molecule-type QMMM_model between atoms 17 OG and 18 HG has an
  estimated oscillational period of 9.0e-03 ps, which is less than 10 times
  the time step of 1.0e-03 ps.
  Maybe you forgot to change the constraints mdp option.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 63.00

NOTE 7 [file testopt.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.
